# Welcome to the FWRI Coral Research Program's Repositories  

### Overview:
[The Fish & Wildlife Institute's Coral Research Program](https://myfwc.com/research/habitat/coral/) manages Florida reef survey data from multiple public and private organizations. Our data is collected by teams of interdisciplinary researchers on more than 70 reef sites spanning the Florida coast, Florida Keys, and Dry Tortugas! Survey data is colected either in-situ by observers (coral counts, coverage, and condition), or via autonomous logging devices installed at sites and monitored by researchers (temperature). 

The majority of our long-term ecological data comes from the [Coral Reef Evaluation & Monitoring Project](https://myfwc.com/research/habitat/coral/cremp/) (CREMP), which has been conducting reef surveys in Florida since 1996, the results of which are visualized and summarized on the CREMP [Dashboard](https://myfwc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/275adbe06cac4e8da1a1d2e8e49318f2). The data collected through this LTER project, as well as the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Evaluation & Moniroting Project (SECREMP), can be found on the Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission's [GIS & Mapping Data Downloads](https://geodata.myfwc.com/search?q=Coral%20Reef%20Evaluation%20Monitoring%20Project) page.
