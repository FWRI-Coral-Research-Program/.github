## Overview:
[The Fish & Wildlife Institute's Coral Research Program](https://myfwc.com/research/habitat/coral/) (FWRI CRP) manages Florida reef survey data from multiple public and private organizations. Our data is collected by teams of interdisciplinary researchers on more than 70 [reef sites](https://myfwc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ea7ac98649474cb9af7a6a20c823846d) spanning the Florida coast, Florida Keys, and Dry Tortugas! Survey data is collected on site by trained observers (coral counts, coverage, and condition), or via autonomous logging devices installed at sites and monitored by researchers (temperature).

The majority of our long-term ecological data comes from the [Coral Reef Evaluation & Monitoring Project](https://myfwc.com/research/habitat/coral/cremp/) (CREMP), which has been conducting reef surveys in Florida since 1996, the results of which are visualized and summarized on the CREMP [Dashboard](https://myfwc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/275adbe06cac4e8da1a1d2e8e49318f2). To download the data collected through CREMP, as well as the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Evaluation & Moniroting Project (SECREMP), please visit the Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission's [GIS & Mapping Data Downloads](https://geodata.myfwc.com/search?q=Coral%20Reef%20Evaluation%20Monitoring%20Project) page.

The FWRI CRP repositories posted here will house the scripts (.Qmd, .Rmd, .R, etc.) used to clean, standardize, and manipulate FWRI data, and will each contain work on a specific dataset. Metadata for each data set will be found in the corresponding respositories as README.md files, with additional data summaries at the top of each individual script. Should you have any additional questions or comments regarding data organization, origin, or use, please direct them to our associated email.

* Note: Please be aware that at this time we are cleaning and streamlining our databases to increase ease of use and public accessibility. As this project is ongoing, repositories will be populated and metadata updated as progress is made. Thank you for your patience!
